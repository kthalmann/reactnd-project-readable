# Readable - Udacity React Nanodegree

This is my Readable Project for the React Nanodegree @ Udacity.

It's a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

I used [PaperCSS](https://www.getpapercss.com/), a tiny CSS Framework for the UI.

I forked the [repo with the server code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) and built my app using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)

## Run

* Install and start the API server from the root directory
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`

* Install and start the Frontend from the root directory
    - `cd app`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
